## Activities
### News Page
The `NewsPage` widget displays a list of cybersecurity news articles fetched from the NewsAPI. It supports offline functionality and dynamically updates the list of articles based on the user's search query. Articles can be filtered by title and description.

### News Detail Page
The `NewsDetailPage` widget displays detailed information about a specific news article. It includes the article's title, author, published date, description, content, and a link to the full article. Users can also copy the article link to the clipboard.

### Search Activity
The `SearchActivity` widget allows users to search for exploits using the `Shodan Exploits API`. It provides a search bar where users can enter their search term and displays a list of matching exploits. Exploits can be selected to view more details.

### Splash Activity
The `SplashActivity` widget is a splash screen that appears when the app is launched. It displays a loading animation and transitions to the main activity after a certain duration.
